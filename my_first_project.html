                            <p>The lyrics to her first hit song brought a lot of attention to her, it made her gained lot of fans just like me, smiles, as the lyrics was more like words of encouragement that you can do it and its okay to feel low but do not loose yourself in that moment try to brace up and make yourself that person you planned to be. she also noted that everyone is trying to find their own way so lets not also not expect too much from people and make sure you do speak out.</p>
